# Hanji
![Example](example.png)
Minimalistic, responsive MediaWiki skin

Inspired by [Namu Wiki](https://namu.wiki)

Hanji is in development now. It looks nice on normal pages, but needs more work on special ones.

## Requirements
Mediawiki 1.25 and above

## Install
Clone this repository on your mediawiki `skins` directory.

Then rename the directory as `Hanji`.

Add the following in your `LocalSettings.php`:
```php
require_once "$IP/skins/hanji-mediawiki/Hanji.php";
```

Done!
